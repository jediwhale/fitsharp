!3 Stored functions are treated like procs - just put ? in the result column header

!|Execute Procedure|ConcatenateF|
|firststring|secondstring|?|
|Hello|World|Hello World|
|Ford|Prefect|Ford Prefect|

!|Execute Procedure|ConcatenateF|
|secondstring|?|firststring|
|World|Hello World|Hello|
|Prefect|Ford Prefect|Ford|
