<div class="pagename">Tagging test pages</div>
<div class="content">This is a description of the tagging feature of <a href="../Fit/FolderRunner.html">Folder Runner</a>.<p>
  Fit's native mechanism for grouping test pages is in <i>suites</i>. In the 
  case of <a href="../Fit/FolderRunner.html">Folder Runner</a>, a suite is 
  represented by a file system folder, so test pages are organized in a suite 
  hierarchy where every suite has three more or less explicit functions;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Group related test pages together and organize them in a logical manner 
    </li>
    <li>Allow for execution of a sub-set of tests, e.g. use -i to select a 
    subfolder or single page of the entire suite</li>
    <li>Act as a context for setup/teardown and suite setup/teardown, to provide 
    test pages with reusable before/after steps.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
  Unfortunately, suite hierarchies are naturally one-to-many, i.e. a test page 
  can only belong to one single suite.</p>
  <p>
  Tagging, on the other hand, is more free-form. It's naturally many-to-many, 
  i.e. many test pages can share a single tag, and a single test page can have 
  many tags.
  This is primarily useful as an additional selection mechanism for #2 above. 
  The tag selection and suite/page selection are orthogonal and can be used 
  together to select tagged pages across multiple suites.</p>
  <h4>Tagging</h4>
  <p>You tag a page by adding an HTML element with id <code>fit_tags</code>. For 
  example, to tag a page with &quot;ShoppingBasket&quot; 
  and &quot;Regression&quot;, add an element like this;</p>
  <p>
  <pre>    &lt;p <b>id=&quot;fit_tags&quot;</b>&gt;Tags: ShoppingBasket,Regression&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
  </p>
  <p>The highlighted id attribute is what marks this as a tag specification. Note that you can use any element type; &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, etc, 
  as long as it has an id of <code>fit_tags</code>. Also, you are free to add style attributes to highlight or hide the tag 
  specification, so you can format pages to your taste. We prefer to keep tags visible, because it makes sense for users 
  editing the page to know which tags apply to it.</p>
  <p>The format of the element contents allows any prefix label (<i>Tags:</i> 
  in the example above), so you can use a localized label as long as it ends 
  with a colon. The prefix label is optional, if there's no colon in the 
  contents, it's assumed that there is no prefix label, and the entire string 
  will be interpreted as a tag list. </p>
  <p>A tag list is simply a comma-separated 
  list of tag names. The only rules for tag names are;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They must not contain a comma</li>
    <li>They must not have leading or trailing whitespace</li>
    <li>They should not contain wildcard characters &quot;*&quot; and &quot;?&quot;, because those 
    are reserved for wildcard filtering</li>
    <li>They should not contain the &quot;:&quot; character, because the first colon is 
    used to locate the optional prefix label. Colons in tags works well as long 
    as there is a prefix label.</li>
    <li>The tag list must not contain HTML markup, it is expected to be plain 
    text</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For an example of a tagged page, see
  <a href="SampleInputFiles/SampleSimpleTest.html">SampleSimpleTest.html</a>.</p>

  <h4>Filtering</h4>
  <p>The <a href="../Fit/FolderRunner.html">Folder Runner</a> command-line 
  allows you to specify a tag list, which is used as a filter to only execute 
  the pages that match the command-line argument. Wildcards are supported in 
  filters, so you can match partial tag names easily.</p>
  <p>Given the example with &quot;ShoppingBasket, Regression&quot; above, the page will be 
  executed if;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No tag filter list is provided on the command-line</li>
    <li>&quot;ShoppingBasket&quot; is provided</li>
    <li>&quot;ShoppingBasket, Regression&quot; is provided</li>
    <li>&quot;shoppingbasket, regression&quot; is provided, because matching is case 
    insensitive</li>
    <li>&quot;Reg*&quot; is provided, because matching supports wildcards</li>
  </ul>
  <p>But it will not be executed if;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;Checkout,Regression&quot; is provided, because it doesn't have the Checkout 
    tag</li>
    <li>&quot;ShoppingBasket, WorkInProgress&quot; is provided, because it doesn't have 
    the WorkInProgress tag</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That is, all tag filters provided on the command-line must match the page for it 
  to be executed.</p>
  <p>If you take care with tag naming, you can use wildcard filtering to do an 
  OR-match of pages, which is otherwise not supported. A common tag prefix can 
  be used to allow tag filters to group these tags together. For example, pages 
  tagged;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;feature.notifications.email&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;feature.notifications.twitter&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;feature.notifications.phone&quot;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>can all be executed with a tag filter of &quot;feature.notifications.*&quot;.</p>
  <p>Note that there are no filtering mechanisms for executing entirely untagged pages or 
  pages <i>without</i> a specific tag.</p>
