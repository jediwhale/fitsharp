<div class="content">These are the changes between <span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif"><i>fit</i>Sharp</span> Fit and FitNesse.NET. Based on feedback, I may provide backwards compatibility for some of these if they are show stoppers for current FitNesse.NET users.<br>
<ul><li>The names of some elements in the <a href="../FitSharp/SuiteConfigurationFile.html">Suite Configuration File</a> have been changed as part of a general clean up of namespace and class names.</li><li><a href="../Fit/GracefulNames.html">Graceful Names</a> handling uses the FitNesse algorithm for all fixtures, even FitLibrary fixtures. i.e., all special characters are removed. Fit Version Fixture can enable the FitLibrary algorithm where special characters are replaced with words. You can include this as the first table on a test page: <pre class="test">|fit version|fitlibrary1|</pre></li><li>Cell handlers have been replaced with a new construct: <a href="../Fit/CellOperators.html">Cell Operators</a>. All the existing cell handlers have been converted into cell operators. More documentation to come on this. Cell Handler Loader Fixture still recognizes the old cell handler names and translates them into the equivalent cell operator names.</li></ul></div>
